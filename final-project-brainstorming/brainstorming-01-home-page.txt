For my home page, I would like the viewer to see that I am a game developer. There would be a theme that revolves around games and the work I've done. I would include a picture of the studio I belong to and maybe a picture of one of my works. I would want the home page to have an appealing color choice and maybe some typical "video game" styled graphics added. I would also want the viewer to get some insight into the games I'm particularly fond of, so I might include some of my favorite works from others.
