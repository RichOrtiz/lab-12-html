On my about me page, I would talk about my passion for developing video games. I would include a brief history of what led me to want to create video games. I would also how I'm using my education to further my knowledge and capabilities in game development. I would also include my involvement in outside-of-school activities such as in clubs and my game studio. I will also include a sentence about what my future works will be like.
